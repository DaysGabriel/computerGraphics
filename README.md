# computerGraphics

Pretty much all the openGL projects I completed during the "computer graphics" class at "Universidade Federal do Cear√°".

The professor decided to use a top-down approach to the subject by using an engine that he created himself, but I
am pretty fond of knowing what actually happens behind the scenes, so, in addition to his lectures, I thought it
would be nice to study the low level details and "climb up" to the point I can create complex projects in openGL
using freeglut.

In this repository, you can see all my latest adventures in this journey.
